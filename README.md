# Meteor JS

What is Meteor?
- A platform for building web, iOS, and Android apps in JavaScript

Why use Meteor?
- Build apps for any device from a single codebase
- JavaScript on the front end and the back end
- Integrate with technologies you already use and love

## Code Sample
This repository contains an example Task List app adapted from the Meteor with React tutorial available on https://www.meteor.com/. 
It is intended to be a good example/starting point for beginners to the platform.
